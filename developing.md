## Building Malloy

Building the Malloy repo requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/), and a [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (JRE 1.6 or higher, 1.8 recommended) installed on your system in order to build the Malloy projecti.

Alternatively, you can use [nix](https://nixos.org/) to install these dependencies. To use nix,Â install it with `curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh` and then run `nix-shell` from the `malloy/` directory. Nix is what _CI_ uses to run builds.

The following will install dependencies for the entire set of packages and compile both the Malloy language and the VSCode extension.

```bash
yarn install
yarn build-extension
```

## Malloy VSCode Extension

The Malloy VSCode extension's source is in the `malloy-vscode` directory.

### Installation

To build and install the current version of the extension, first ensure that you've followed the steps to install the dependencies for the Malloy Repo. **Note: You will need to re-run the below any time you pull in new changes.** Then run:

```bash
yarn build-extension
```

Next, in VSCode _EITHER_:

1. Run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX" command (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P opens the command interface), then select `/malloy/packages/malloy-vscode/malloy-vscode-x.x.x.vsix`

_OR_

2. Open the `malloy-vscode` package root directory in VSCode, right click on `malloy-vscode-x.x.x.vsix` and select "Install Extension VSIX".

# Malloy and Extension Development

2. Select the "Run and Debug" panel in the left bar.
